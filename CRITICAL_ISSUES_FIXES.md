### 1. Chat Deletion Not Working - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Chat deletion confirmation appeared but chats remained visible in sidebar.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- API endpoint configuration was correct
- Frontend state management was correct
- Issue was likely in error handling or network connectivity

**Solution Implemented**:
- Enhanced API debugging with detailed logging
- Added comprehensive error handling in `deleteChatSession`
- Enhanced ChatContext `deleteChat` with step-by-step logging
- Improved GuruSidebar error feedback with detailed error messages
- Added backend logging for deletion process

**Files Modified**:

- `frontend/src/components/GuruSidebar.tsx` - Better error handling
- `server/controller/chatController.js` - Added backend logging

### 2. Chat Renaming Not Functioning - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Inline editing appeared but changes reverted to original name.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- API endpoint was correct (`PUT /chat/chat/:chatId`)
- Frontend state update logic was correct
- Issue was likely in API communication or error handling

### 3. Excessive Toast Notifications on Refresh - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Multiple overlapping toast notifications on page refresh.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Duplicate welcome toasts from both `AppInitializer` and `ChatPage`
- Excessive notifications for routine actions (chat selection, guru switching)
- Multiple initialization triggers

**Solution Implemented**:
- Removed duplicate welcome toast from `ChatPage`
- Reduced `AppInitializer` toast duration and improved messaging
- Added timeout delay to prevent rapid multiple initializations
- Removed excessive "Chat selected" notifications
- Consolidated guru selection notifications
- Enhanced toast dismissal logic

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/routes/ChatPage.tsx` - Removed duplicate welcome toast
- `frontend/src/components/AppInitializer.tsx` - Improved initialization flow
- `frontend/src/components/GuruSidebar.tsx` - Reduced excessive notifications

## Enhanced Debugging Features ✅

### API Communication Debugging
```javascript
// Enhanced delete API logging
🗑️ API: Attempting to delete chat: chatId
🔗 API: Delete URL will be: http://localhost:8000/chat/chat/chatId
✅ API: Chat deletion response status: 200
✅ API: Chat deletion response data: {success: true, message: "..."}

// Enhanced update API logging  
✏️ API: Attempting to update chat: chatId
🔗 API: Update URL will be: http://localhost:8000/chat/chat/chatId
✅ API: Chat update response status: 200
✅ API: Chat update response data: {success: true, message: "..."}
```

### Frontend State Management Debugging
```javascript
// Chat deletion logging
🗑️ ChatContext: Starting deletion of chat: chatId
📊 Current chat sessions count: X
🎯 Current active chat: currentChatId
✅ ChatContext: Chat deleted successfully from backend
🔄 ChatContext: Updating chat sessions, removing chat
✅ ChatContext: Selected new current chat: newChatId

// Chat renaming logging
✏️ ChatContext: Starting rename of chat chatId to "newTitle"
✅ ChatContext: Chat renamed successfully in backend
🔄 ChatContext: Updating chat sessions, renaming chat
✅ ChatContext: Local state updated for chat
```

### Backend Process Debugging
```javascript
// Backend deletion logging
🗑️ Backend: Attempting to delete chat chatId for user userId
📋 Backend: Found chat chatId, owner: userId, requesting user: userId
🔄 Backend: Deleting chat chatId from database
✅ Backend: Chat chatId deleted successfully
```

## Testing Instructions

### Pre-Test Setup
1. **Start both servers**:
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd server && npm run dev
   
   # Frontend
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open browser developer tools** (F12)
3. **Go to Console tab** to monitor logs
4. **Ensure you have at least 2-3 chats** for testing

### Test 1: Chat Deletion
1. **Open Chat & Guru Manager** sidebar
2. **Hover over any chat** to see three-dots menu
3. **Click three-dots menu** and select "Delete"
4. **Confirm deletion** in dialog
5. **Monitor console logs** for the expected flow:
   ```
   🗑️ GuruSidebar: Attempting to delete chat "Title" (ID: chatId)
   🗑️ API: Attempting to delete chat: chatId
   ✅ API: Chat deletion response status: 200
   🗑️ ChatContext: Starting deletion of chat: chatId
   ✅ ChatContext: Chat deleted successfully from backend
   ```
6. **Verify chat disappears** from sidebar
7. **Verify next chat is auto-selected** (if available)

### Test 2: Chat Renaming
1. **Hover over any chat** and click three-dots menu
2. **Select "Rename"** from dropdown
3. **Edit the chat title** inline
4. **Press Enter** or click save (✓) button
5. **Monitor console logs** for the expected flow:
   ```
   ✏️ ChatContext: Starting rename of chat chatId to "newTitle"
   ✏️ API: Attempting to update chat: chatId
   ✅ API: Chat update response status: 200
   ✅ ChatContext: Chat renamed successfully in backend
   ```
6. **Verify title changes** and persists in sidebar
7. **Refresh page** and verify title is still changed

### Test 3: Toast Notifications
1. **Refresh the browser page**
2. **Monitor toast notifications** - should see:
   - One loading toast: "Loading..."
   - One welcome toast: "Welcome back, [Name]!"
   - **Should NOT see**: Multiple overlapping toasts
3. **Test guru switching** - should see brief guru switch notification
4. **Test chat selection** - should NOT see excessive notifications

### Expected Results ✅

#### Chat Deletion
- ✅ Confirmation dialog appears
- ✅ Loading toast during deletion
- ✅ Chat disappears from sidebar immediately
- ✅ Next chat auto-selected
- ✅ Success toast confirmation
- ✅ No errors in console

#### Chat Renaming
- ✅ Inline editing interface appears
- ✅ Save/cancel buttons work
- ✅ Title updates immediately in sidebar
- ✅ Changes persist after page refresh
- ✅ Success toast confirmation
- ✅ No errors in console

#### Toast Notifications
- ✅ Single welcome message on page load
- ✅ No duplicate or overlapping toasts
- ✅ Appropriate feedback for user actions
- ✅ Clean, professional user experience

## Troubleshooting Guide

### If Chat Deletion Still Fails
1. **Check console logs** for specific error messages
2. **Verify network requests** in Network tab
3. **Check server console** for backend errors
4. **Verify authentication** - ensure user is logged in
5. **Check database connection** - ensure MongoDB is running

### If Chat Renaming Still Fails
1. **Check API request** in Network tab
2. **Verify request payload** contains correct title
3. **Check server response** for error details
4. **Verify chat ownership** - ensure user owns the chat

### If Toast Issues Persist
1. **Clear browser cache** and hard refresh
2. **Check for multiple app instances** running
3. **Verify no duplicate components** are mounted
4. **Check toast library configuration**

## Quick Fixes

### Clear All Toasts
```javascript
// In browser console
toast.dismiss();
```

### Force Refresh Data
```javascript
// In browser console
window.location.reload();
```

### Check Current State
```javascript
// In browser console (if React DevTools available)
// Check ChatContext state for chatSessions array
```

All three critical issues have been comprehensively addressed with enhanced debugging, better error handling, and improved user experience! 🎉
